# IsingModel

In the physics university context, this project is on the study of the 2D Ising model.  
This project uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to show the famous physical phenomenon on the magnetisation.  
In addition, I use **variance reduction** to increase the precision of the simulation and I use **OpenMP** to increase the execution time.  

To exect the project :
  *  install PNL library with ./install_lib.sh
  *  regenerate the build with ./regen_build.sh
