# IsingModel

In the physics university context, this project is on the study of the 2D Ising model.  
This project uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to show the famous physical phenomenon on the magnetisation.  
In addition, I use **variance reduction** to increase the precision of the simulation and I use **OpenMP** to increase the execution time.  

To exect the project, you need to regenerate the build with ./regen_build.sh  
To exect the test, go to /built and make check
